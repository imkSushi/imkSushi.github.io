<p>I don't want to sound like a beggar, but if you like what I do (mostly coding for my Mod for Terraria at the moment), I could do with a donation. This money will go towards my life in general, i.e. help me pay for university, help me buy a house etc., so any donations of any amounts would really help me. Thanks.</p>

<p>At this point, the website splits into a couple parts: imkSushi's Mod, The London Underground, Maths, Doctor Who, and other stuff.</p>
<h2>imkSushi's Mod</h2>
<h4>A nice banner thingy by <span id = MinieK>MinieK</span>:</h4>
<img id = ModLogo src="http://i.imgur.com/DYsg78I.png">

<p>Now onto some actual stuff about my mod:</p>
<p><span id = brd class = green>imkSushi's Mod is an essentials/quality of life mod. It adds hundreds of recipes to Terraria that means that any items that may be unobtainable in a world due to unfortunate world gen are now craftable. However, the main feature is that equivalent ore are now interchangeable at a Tinkerers Workbench, for example, you can swap iron for lead, or Titanium for Adamantite. Another prominent feature is that you can melt down many items back into the ore they came from at lava. For a more complete list of what this mod adds, see <a href="http://forums.terraria.org/index.php?threads/imksushis-mod.34233/">the thread for imkSushi's Mod</a>.</span></p>
<h2>The London Underground</h2>
<p>In case you didn't know, I know everything you ever, and never, wanted to know about the London Underground. Below, I have stuff about the London Underground:</p>
<h3>Part 1 - Opening</h3>
<p class = UndergroundStuff>The London Underground is the first Underground Railway in the world. It was opened on 10<sup>th</sup> January 1863 between Paddington (Bishop's Road) and Farringdon Street, via Edgware Road, Baker Street, Portland Road, Gower Street, and King's Cross. Nowadays a lot of these have lightly different names: Paddington (Bishop's Road) has dropped the (Bishop's Road) bit, Portland Road has become Great Portland Street, Gower Street has become Euston Square, King's Cross has become King's Cross St Pancras, and Farringdon Street has dropped the 'Street' bit. Together, when they opened, they were called the Metropolitan railway. At this point, you may be expecting me to explain what happened next, but, on the contrary, I will explain what lead up to the circumstances that the London Underground was opened in the first place, and use that to explain what happened next.</p>
<h3>Part 2 - Build Up</h3>
<p class = UndergroundStuff>In the mid 1800s, a soliciter, named Charles Pearson, pushed for an underground railway to be built under London, in order to allieviate traffic. At that time, the average speed on those roads were 10mph, and slowing. After a while, a committee set up suggested first in 1846 that no train lines were build in central London, as that would disrupt traffic even more, and then in 1854, they recommended that the Metropolitan Railway was given the go-ahead. The act that let the Railway get started was called <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/about/living-heritage/transformingsociety/transportcomms/roadsrail/from-the-parliamentary-collections/london-underground/act/">An Act to alter and extend the North Metropolitan Railway, and to consolidate and amend the Provisions relating thereto</a>. Eventually, by 1860, they were organised enough to get to start construction, an dthey planned to finish it for 1862, only two years later, quite ambitious. They narrowly missed this, and it opened on the date mentioned above.</p>
<h3>Part 3 - Inner Circle</h3>
<p class = UndergroundStuff>A couple years after the Met opened, some people suggested that it should be extended to circe around central London and thereby serve more mainline stations. This was mutilated into the new Metropolitan District Railway, which opened in 1868. This was more expensive than the Met to build, as the Metropolitan was built under roads, but because of delays, in order to build the District, they had to rip up some of the newly made Embankment to put the District Line in. Whereas the Metropolitan hat a budget of only £1000000, a lot at the time, and most of which went to the head engineer, John Fowler, the District cost more than £5000000, and was still short on money. the district was intended to meet up with the Met to form the previously mentioned 'Inner Circle', however, because both railways had other ambitions, it took till 1884 for the Inner Circle to be finished. During the opening, the chairmen of both railways, James Staat Forbes, and Edward Watkin, who hated each other, managed to share a carriage around the entire railway without saying a word to each other. next, i will go on about the other ambitions.</p>
<h3>Part 4 - Other Ambitions</h3>
<p class = UndergroundStuff>The reason why the Circle line took so long to complete, is due to the Met and District expanding outwards instead of inwards. Edward Watkin, who was in charge of the Metropolitan had high ambitions. Believe it or not, he wanted the Metropolitan to go to France in a Channel Tunnel, more than a full century before the tunnel was built. As we know today, the Metropolitan didn't get nearly as far as France, although it did get out into the wild countryside, and then even further to the likes of Brill and Verney Junction in the North West. The District had similar, though far less ambitious plans. In the east, Forbes expanded his railway all the way to Southend, although not all on District's own lines, and in the west, the District got as far as Windsor, before retreating a couple years later. All of this expansion was the start of a phenomenom that carried on for more than half a century: <b>Metroland</b></p>
<h3>Part 5 - Metroland</h3>
<p class = UndergroundStuff>I need to get around to writing this you know, I'm not John Betjeman.</p>
<h2>Maths!</h2>
<p>I like maths. I do a lot of maths. Below, I show some of the maths I have done</p>
<p class = maths>Did you know that for all <em class = algebra>x = 0, 1, 2 ... 9, 10</em>, that the following is true: <em class = algebra>x&#185;&#185;-55x&#185;&#8304;+1320x&#8313;-18150x&#8312;+157773x&#8311;-902055x&#8310;+3416930x&#8309;-8409500x&#8308;+12753576x&sup3;-10528650x&sup2;+3628800x = 0</em></p>
	<div class = maths>
		<p>1. Take any factor of 24, for example: <em class = algebra>3</em></p>
		<p>2. Multiply it by any positive integer, for example: <em class = algebra>11 &rarr; 11 * 3 = 33</em></p>
		<p>3. Subtract 1, for example: <em class = algebra>33 - 1 = 32</em></p>
		<p>4. The sum of any two opposite factors of this new number will be divisible by the original factor.<br>For example:<br><em class = algebra>32 = 1 * 32, 1 + 32 = 33 &rarr; 33 = 3 * 11<br>32 = 2 * 16, 2 + 16 = 18 &rarr; 18 = 3 * 6<br>32 = 4 * 8, 4 + 8 = 12 &rarr; 12 = 3 * 4</em></p>
	</div>
<p class = maths>Did you know that for any integer (larger than one) '<em class = algebra>n</em>', the following is always true:<br><em class = algebra>2<sup class = algebra>n</sup> Modulo n &ne; 1</em></p>
<h2>Doctor Who</h2>
<h4 class = middlepage>(and spinoffs)</h4>
	<img id = tardis src="Tardis.png">
<p class = DoctorWho> It occurs to me when writing this, that in order to get the style for this paragraph, I set it to have 'class = DoctorWho'. Gosh. I'm looking forward to both Doctor Who Series 10, and Class Series 1, and I have seen the trailors! I am excited. I hope you are as well. More stuff to come.</p>
