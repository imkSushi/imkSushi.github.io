<!--I might add a few more paragraphs, but this is not a very priority-->
<p class=first><!---->Coding is currently in progress, the page might look very messy! -->This webpage will be about the London Underground. Lots of people talk of it as the Tube, but only some lines are made of tubes. All the other lines should be called the Sub-surface (the Circle, District, Metropolitan and Hammersmith &amp City Lines).</p>
<p id=birth>The London Underground was opened in 1863 between Paddington and Farringdon Street on the Metropolitan Line (or Railway as it was called).</p>
<p class=first>In the last few decades, the London Underground has become very crowded, so the owners, Transport For London (TFL), have made bigger trains, staions and increased reliability.</p>
<p class=not-first>In order to lessen traffic on the London Underground even more, Crossrail is due to be opened in 2018, and will cross London, as implied in the name. This will reduce congestion on the Central line the most, as it follows the same basic route through London.</p>
<p class=suprise>In January 2013, the London Underground had its 150th anniversary. Thats very old!</p>
<p class=closed>The closed for refurbishment/rebuilding stations/platforms on the London Underground at the moment is Bond Street.</p>

<h2 class=lines>Facts about the different lines</h2>
<ul class=lines>The Bakerloo Line
<li class=lines>The Bakerloo Line was opened on 10<sup class=lines>th</sup> March 1906 between Baker Street and Lambeth North</li>
<li class=lines>The Bakerloo Line was originally called the Baker Street and Waterloo Railway, but the name Bakerloo was adopted when it appeared in a headline in the <cite class=lines>Evening News</cite></li>
Scroll down to see the Central Line below!</ul>
<ul class=lines>The Central Line
<li class=lines>The Central Line was opened on 27<sup class=lines>th</sup> June 1900 between Shepherds Bush and Bank.</li>
<li class=lines>The only station which has escalators to take the passengers up from ground level to the platform is Greenford.</li>
<li class=lines>When the Central Line was opened in 1900, the traffic accidents plunged.</li>
<li class=lines>The platforms were put on <q class=lines>platform humps</q> to help the trains slow down as they came into a station, and accelerate as they came out.</li>
Scroll down to see the Circle Line below!</ul>
<ul class=lines>The Circle Line
<li class=lines>The Circle Line was finished in 1884, when the District Railway and the Metropolitan Railway ran some trains in a circle around London.</li>
<li class=lines>The Circle Line was originally called the Inner Circle, as it was the inner circle of London, as opposed to the outer circle.</li>
<li class=lines>On 28<sup class=lines>th</sup> March 1905, the first successful run of an electric train ran along the South of the Circle Line. The electrification of all the line finished on 1<sup class=lines>st</sup> July 1905.</li>
Scroll down to see the District Line below!</ul>
<ul class=lines>The District Line
<li class=lines>The District Line was opened on 24<sup class=lines>th</sup> December 1868 between South Kensington and Westminster.</li>
<li class=lines>Even though the chairmen hated each other, The Metropolitan Railway and the Metropolitan District Railway created a deal to create two circlesaround London, the Inner Circle, and the Outer Circle.</li>Scroll down to see the Hammersmith &amp City Line below!</ul><ul class=lines>The Hammersmith and City Line
<li class=lines>The Hammersmith &amp City Line is an offspring of the Metropolitan Railway, but unlike the Circle Line, the Metropolitan District Railway had nothing to do with it.</li>
<li class=lines>Every single station on the Hammersmith &amp City Line is a station on another line as well. The same applies to the Circle Line.</li>Scroll down to see the Jubilee Line below!</ul>
<ul class=lines>The Jubilee Line
    <li class=lines>The Jubilee Line was opened in 1979 between Charing Cross and Baker Street, with Baker Street to Stanmore later changing from Bakerloo Line to Jubilee Line.</li>

</ul><ul class=lines>The Metropolitan Line
    <li class=lines>The Metropolitan (not Metrapolitan) Line was opened on 9<sup class=lines>th</sup> January 1863, and was the first line to be opened.</li>
    <li class=lines>The railway was the first railway to have trains that did not let all its steam out the funnel, as that would cloud the tunnel, but condensed a large amount of it, and letting the rest come out the funnel, and the escape above ground through holes above the tunnel, s the tunnels were not far underground.</li>
    <li class=lines>There is a lot more about this line, and on my other London Underground website, which is linked to in the links box below, I will put some of this soon.</li>Scroll down to see the Northern Line below!
</ul>
<ul class=lines>The Northern Line
<li class=lines>The Northern Line was opened in 1890 between Stockwell, and King William Street, and was the first line to open with electricity. It was also the first line to use Deep Level Bore Tunnels, or 'tubes'.</li>
<li class=lines>The Northern Line is actually two railways merged together, one was called the City &amp South London Railway, which built Morden to Camden Town via Bank, and the other is the Hampstead Tube, which built Kennington to High Barnet, Mill Hill East, and Edgware via Charing Cross.</li>
<li class=lines>I am putting a bit about King William station on my other website, linked below in the links box.</li>More coming soon, with the Piccadilly Line next!
