  <h1>Why Radio 4's Puzzle 48 is wrong</h1>
  <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/4wFxDGl9MxgJLD4BZ13WG3t/puzzle-for-today">The relevant puzzle, and the given solution</a>
  <p>The solution is given as 6 steps, because the moving coin rotates twice, and 2*3=6. The issue is, that this is offset by the fact the the surface the Triskelion steps on moves around the edge of the moving coin, so while the coin rotates twice, the ground rotates once as well relative to the coin, and this means that actually, the net rotation is only one, so 1*3=3 steps.</p>
  <p>More simply, as the coin cannot slip, the sides of each coin map directly onto each other, so on one rotation, every edge of the moving coin touches an edge of the stationary coin at exactly one point, so the steps can only happen three times, as there are only three legs.</p>
