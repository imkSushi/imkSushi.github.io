  <h1>sin(θ)²</h1>
		<p>sin²θ really annoys me. Why? Two reasons:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Sine is a function. As such, the value that the function is performed on should be surrounded with brackets, i.e. sin²θ should actually be sin²(θ).</li>
  <li>Usually, for a function 'f', f²(x) = f(f(x)). But for sine, sin²(θ) = sin(θ)², and not sin(sin(θ)).</li>
</ol>
		<h2>How to fix this</h2>
		<p>Convention should be changed to be more consistent - i.e. sin²θ should only ever be written as sin(θ)², and never as sin²θ. Raise awareness by sharing this webpage with your maths/math friends, teachers, relatives, etc.</p>
