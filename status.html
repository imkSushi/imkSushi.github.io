<h1>Statue of imkSushi</h1>
<p>It is coming up once again to the anniversary of the release of imkSushi's mod. For this, I'm planning on recoding much of the mod to make it easier for me to add recipes. Then I may release an API to let people easily edit the recipes in my mod (but I'm not 100% sure about that). FYI, my mod was first released on 1st October 2015.</p>
