<h1>The Atomic Scale</h1>
<p>There are several ways to image a surface on the atomic scale, if you want to find, for example, the structure of the surface, or anomalies on the surface of the material. There are three main types of microscopes that are capable of imaging these tiny things. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atomic Force Microscopes</li>
<li>Scanning Tunneling Microscopes</li>
<li>Scanning Electron Microscopes</li>
</ul>
